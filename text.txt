In this video, the presenter provides a comprehensive guide on how to remove Snap packages from Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution. Snap is a package management system that bundles applications with all their necessary files, libraries, and dependencies, allowing them to run smoothly across various systems. While convenient, Snap packages tend to occupy more disk space and are slower to launch compared to traditional packages like DEB or RPM, leading users to seek alternatives.

The tutorial begins with a recommendation to back up your system using TimeShift, a snapshot tool, to ensure that you can restore your system in case anything goes wrong during the uninstallation process. Users are advised to back up the entire root system and user directories using TimeShift before proceeding with the deletion of Snap packages.

To see which Snap packages are currently installed, you can use the command snap list. The presenter then instructs viewers to close all applications (except for the terminal) and to consider using alternative browsers, like Google Chrome or Brave, as DEB packages.

The uninstallation process starts with removing applications like Firefox, as well as associated snap packages like gtk-common-themes, gnome-desktop-integration, snap-store, and others. Following these removals, the core Snap package and Snapd (the service that manages Snap packages) are deleted. The presenter emphasizes the importance of stopping and disabling the Snapd service to prevent it from starting automatically in the future.

Next, commands are provided to purge Snapd completely and prevent it from being upgraded inadvertently. The user is also guided through deleting Snap package directories and creating a preference file to reinforce the removal of Snap.

To replace Firefox's Snap package, the video details the steps to install the Firefox DEB package instead. Viewers learn how to set up the Mozilla APT repository to ensure they receive proper updates and installation for their applications.

Finally, the presenter addresses the absence of a graphical application store after removing Snap packages and suggests installing the vanilla GNOME Software Center as a solution. As an added bonus, the video also explains how to restore Snap packages using TimeShift if users decide they want them back.

In conclusion, this guide not only teaches users how to uninstall Snap packages but also provides insights into the benefits of using DEB packages over Snap, ensuring a smoother and faster application experience on Ubuntu. Viewers are encouraged to leave comments and inquiries for future videos.

Install Firefox .deb package for Debian-based distributions (Recommended)

To install the .deb package through the APT repository, do the following:

    Create a directory to store APT repository keys if it doesn't exist:

    sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/apt/keyrings

    Import the Mozilla APT repository signing key:

    wget -q https://packages.mozilla.org/apt/repo-signing-key.gpg -O- | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.mozilla.org.asc > /dev/null
    If you do not have wget installed, you can install it with: sudo apt-get install wget

    The fingerprint should be 35BAA0B33E9EB396F59CA838C0BA5CE6DC6315A3. You may check it with the following command:

    gpg -n -q --import --import-options import-show /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.mozilla.org.asc | awk '/pub/{getline; gsub(/^ +| +$/,""); if($0 == "35BAA0B33E9EB396F59CA838C0BA5CE6DC6315A3") print "\nThe key fingerprint matches ("$0").\n"; else print "\nVerification failed: the fingerprint ("$0") does not match the expected one.\n"}'

    Next, add the Mozilla APT repository to your sources list:

    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.mozilla.org.asc] https://packages.mozilla.org/apt mozilla main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mozilla.list > /dev/null

    Configure APT to prioritize packages from the Mozilla repository:

    echo '
    Package: *
    Pin: origin packages.mozilla.org
    Pin-Priority: 1000
    ' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla

    Update your package list, and install the Firefox .deb package:

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox

Set up different languages in Firefox with .deb files

For those of you who would like to use Firefox in a different language than American English, we have also created .deb packages containing the Firefox language packs. To install a specific language pack, replace fr in the example below with the desired language code:

sudo apt-get install firefox-l10n-fr

To list all the available language packs, you can use this command after adding the Mozilla APT repository and running sudo apt-get update:

apt-cache search firefox-l10n
